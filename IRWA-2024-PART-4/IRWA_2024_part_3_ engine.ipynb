The F1 score of 0.46 reflects this balance, while the average precision of 0.29 implies that relevant documents may not be consistently ranked at the top.

This helps identify tweets whose word composition is most similar to the query.\n","\n","5. **Calculate the Custom Score (Your-Score)**:  \n","   We combine the popularity score and cosine similarity into a custom metric, called `our_score`, calculated as:\n","\n","   $$\n","   \\text{our_score} = \\text{tweet_mark} \\times \\text{cosine_similarity}\n","   $$\n","\n","   This score weighs tweets that are not only popular but also relevant to the query in terms of word composition.\n","\n","6. **Top 20 Recommended Tweets**:  \n","   Finally, we sort the tweets by `our_score` and select the top 20 as recommendations, providing a list of tweets that are both popular and relevant to the query.\n","\n","This approach allows us to identify the tweets that best respond to a query in terms of thematic relevance and popularity.

In the results above, TF-IDF gives a high similarity score of 1.0 to tweets containing both \"indian\" and \"protest,\" but it also assigns progressively lower scores to tweets with variations of these terms and other additional terms. TF-IDF's reliance on frequency can make it less sensitive to differences in term density within documents, which sometimes leads to similar scores for documents of varying lengths, provided they contain the query terms.\n","\n","BM25, by contrast, is a probabilistic ranking model that not only considers term frequency and document frequency but also adjusts based on document length, rewarding shorter, query-dense tweets. This means BM25 generally assigns higher scores to tweets where query terms are more concentrated and frequent. For example, tweets containing only the essential query terms “indian” and “protest” have the highest BM25 score (8.40), while tweets with additional context score slightly lower. BM25’s ability to scale with document length and term saturation generally allows it to better handle longer texts with relevant terms dispersed throughout.\n","\n","- **TF-IDF Pros**: Simple, computationally efficient, and effective for short, structured text. However, it lacks length normalization, which can make it less effective with documents of varying lengths.\n","- **TF-IDF Cons**: It may miss context, as it doesn’t account for term saturation or document length, potentially overvaluing infrequent terms and underweighting important frequent terms.\n","\n","- **BM25 Pros**: More flexible in handling different text lengths and term frequencies, making it robust for ranking documents of varying lengths, like tweets with diverse content. This makes it highly effective in search tasks and suited for real-world datasets.\n","- **BM25 Cons**: Slightly more computationally intensive due to its length normalization and saturation adjustments.\n","\n","In summary, **BM25** often provides more nuanced rankings, especially beneficial for longer and more complex documents, whereas **TF-IDF** can be effective for simpler, shorter texts, but may lack the same level of adaptability."],"metadata":{"id":"2QFrehdMrtyW"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["**Regarding your own score, justify the choice of the score (pros and cons).

Each of these models has specific use cases, strengths, and limitations compared to Word2Vec. Here’s an overview of these representations, their pros, and cons, along with justifications:*\n","\n","1. **Word2Vec**:\n","- *Word2Vec represents words as dense, fixed-length vectors based on their context within a corpus. It uses techniques like Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) and Skip-gram to learn these representations.*\n","- **Pros**:\n","  - **Efficient**: *Quick to train and scales well to large datasets.*\n","  - **Contextual Similarity**: *Captures semantic relationships between words effectively, enabling operations like \"king\" - \"man\" + \"woman\" ≈ \"queen\".*\n","- **Cons**:\n","  - **Lacks Contextual Awareness**: *The same word has one fixed vector, regardless of its meaning in different contexts.*\n","  - **Sentence and Document Representation**: *Requires post-processing (e.g., averaging word vectors) to create representations for larger text units, which can be crude and lose nuanced meaning.*\n","\n","2. **Doc2Vec**:\n","- *Doc2Vec, an extension of Word2Vec, is designed to create dense, fixed-length vector representations of entire documents. It does this by incorporating a unique document ID that acts as an additional vector trained alongside the word vectors.*\n","- **Pros**:\n","  - **Captures Document-Level Semantics**: *Represents the global context of a document, making it useful for tasks like document classification, topic modeling, and information retrieval.*\n","  - **Better than Averaging**: *Unlike simply averaging word vectors, Doc2Vec learns representations that consider the sequence and structure of words in a document.*\n","- **Cons**:\n","  - **Training Complexity**: *More complex to train and requires more computational resources compared to Word2Vec.*\n","  - **Data Dependence**: *The quality of vectors can be heavily dependent on the training corpus, potentially requiring extensive training data for optimal results.*\n","\n","3. **Sentence2Vec**:\n","- *Sentence2Vec is used to create vector representations for individual sentences. Approaches vary from simple (e.g., averaging word embeddings) to more sophisticated methods, like using pre-trained models (e.g., Universal Sentence Encoder or BERT).*\n","- **Pros**:\n","  - **Sentence-Level Representation**: *Provides vectors that capture the meaning of sentences, which can be more contextually nuanced than Word2Vec or Doc2Vec.*\n","  - **Use in Similarity and Matching**: *Useful for tasks like sentence similarity, semantic search, and chatbot responses.*\n","- **Cons**:\n","  - **Loss of Granularity**: *May overlook fine-grained word-level nuances, especially with simpler methods like averaging.*\n","  - **Complexity with Contextual Models**: *More advanced models, such as those based on transformers, require substantial computational power and may be overkill for simpler applications.*\n","\n","**Comparative Justification**:\n","- **Better Representation?** *Yes, in many cases, Doc2Vec and Sentence2Vec can provide better representations than Word2Vec depending on the task.*\n","  - **Doc2Vec** *is better for document-level tasks as it captures context more holistically, while Word2Vec's scope is limited to individual words.*\n","  - **Sentence2Vec** *is beneficial for sentence-level applications where understanding the flow and semantics of sentences is critical. For more complex, context-dependent representations, transformer-based models like **BERT** (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) surpass Word2Vec by producing different embeddings for the same word in different contexts, enhancing performance in tasks like question answering and sentiment analysis.*\n","\n","**Advanced Alternatives**:\n","- **BERT and Transformer Models**:\n","  - **Pros**: *Highly contextual embeddings, ability to represent polysemy (same word with different meanings).*\n","  - **Cons**: *High computational requirements, slower training and inference.*\n","\n","**Conclusion**:\n","*The choice between Word2Vec, Doc2Vec, Sentence2Vec, and more advanced models like BERT depends on the specific application:*\n","- *For word-level tasks, **Word2Vec** is efficient and straightforward.*\n","- *For document classification or retrieval, **Doc2Vec** offers richer context.*\n","- *For sentence-level tasks, **Sentence2Vec** or **transformer-based models** like **BERT** provide more nuanced and context-aware embeddings.*\n","\n","*Overall, Doc2Vec and Sentence2Vec extend the capabilities of Word2Vec by incorporating more complex contexts and structures, making them preferable for applications that require representations beyond isolated words.*"],"metadata":{"id":"DAmQkMX5IB0e"}}],"metadata":{"colab":{"collapsed_sections":["KQ72UWD6hIr2","yCN4--8kba9p"],"provenance":[]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"base","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.12"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
