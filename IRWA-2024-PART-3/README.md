PART 3 - Project - IRWA
GROUP 102_2: Roger Sola, Queralt Zamora and Cl√†udia Morales
This readme file detailes the execution of the delivered Part 2.

The whole notebook is designed in order to run from the beginning to the end once the "run all" option is setted. The only thing that MUST be change by the teacher while evaluating the lab are the documents file paths.

The variables containg the paths are stated in the beggining of the ipynb notebook with the names docs_path, ids_path and evaluation_path:

Once tha paths have been changed, the notebook is ready for execution. While clicking on "run all" (i.e "Ejecutar todas") all the notebook should give the proper outputs to all exercises.
